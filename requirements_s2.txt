# This file lists Python package dependencies for your local project.
# To install these packages, navigate to your project directory in your terminal
# (preferably within an activated virtual environment) and run:
# pip install -r requirements_s2.txt

# --- System-level dependencies (INSTALL MANUALLY ON YOUR OS if on Linux) ---
# For Linux (e.g., Ubuntu/Debian), run:
# sudo apt-get update
# sudo apt-get install -y sox libsndfile1 ffmpeg portaudio19-dev libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev nvidia-cuda-toolkit
# sudo ldconfig
# For Windows/macOS, you'll need to find equivalent installation methods for:
# - FFmpeg (for pydub)
# - PortAudio (for sounddevice)
# - NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit (if you want GPU support for PyTorch/NeMo and have an NVIDIA GPU)
# - General development libraries (libjpeg-dev, zlib1g-dev might be needed by some packages)

# --- Python Package Dependencies ---

# 1. PyTorch, Torchvision, and TorchAudio (with CUDA 11.8 support)
#    This line explicitly installs a compatible version to resolve ABI issues.
#    Make sure your local CUDA toolkit version matches (or is compatible with) cu118.
torch==2.1.0
torchvision==0.16.0
torchaudio==2.1.0

# 2. Core Python packages for audio handling and utilities
sounddevice
soundfile
numpy<2 # Ensures numpy version is compatible with NeMo/PyTorch
wget
text-unidecode
omegaconf


# 3. CRITICAL FIX: Specific huggingface_hub version for NeMo compatibility
huggingface_hub==0.23.2

# 4. pydub for audio format conversion (requires FFmpeg system-level installation)
pydub

# 5. NeMo toolkit (ASR collection) from a specific branch
#    This will install NeMo and its remaining dependencies.
#    Ensure git is installed on your system for this to work.
